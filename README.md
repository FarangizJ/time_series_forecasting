## Resources

### Books
- Hyndman & Athanasopoulos - *Forecasting: Principles and Practice* (OTexts, 2018)
  [Free online resources] (https://otexts.com/fpp3/)  
  This book offers an excellent introduction to the basics of preprocessing time series data and models to make forecasts. 
  Examples are run in R  
- Nielsen - *Practical Time Series Analysis* (O'Reilly, 2019)  
  Practical guide on most common data engineering and analysis challenges in time series, using both traditional statistical and modern machine learning techniques. 
  Well-rounded introduction to time series in both R and Python.   
- Nield - *Essential Math for Data Science* (O'Reilly, 2022)

### Datasets
accessing datasets in **Python**:   
  *import statsmodels.api as sm*   
  Common time series datasets in statsmodels:  
  sunspots - Monthly sunspot data  
  co2 - Atmospheric CO2 concentrations  
  nile - Annual Nile river flow  
  macrodata - US macroeconomic data  
  elnino - Sea surface temperature data

  Python doesn't have as extensive built-in time series datasets, it also possible to access **R datasets** directly  
  *from statsmodels.datasets import get_rdataset*  

  Directly from **websites**:  
  - [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/) - Time series datasets
  - [NOAA NAtional Centers for Enviromental Information](https://perma.cc/EA5R-TP5L) - US timeseries data related to temperature and precipitation
